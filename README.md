## What this repository stands for

1. Attendance in lab classes for unstructured datbases
2. Marks for the lab copy section of the grading

Before each practical class there will be a folder pushed  with the date of the practical class. In that folder you have to create a file name with your name and roll number. 

**For example:**

My name is Ayushman Bilas Thakur and my roll number is UG/02/BTCSE/2023/001 then my file will be named as - `001_ayushman_bilas_thakur.md` 

**What will go in the markdown file?**

All the commands you have run and the results. Basically what you will be writing in the lab copy.
